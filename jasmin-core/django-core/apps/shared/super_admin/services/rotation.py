"""Super-admin rotation service layer.

Single source of truth for the four rotations of ``OpsChecklistItem``'s
``KIND_CHOICES`` that the super-admin UI and the ``rotate_*`` commands
can run:

  * ``rotate_django_secret``: generates a new ``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY``
    candidate. Django cannot apply this itself — the operator updates
    ``.env`` and recreates the backend and huey containers.

  * ``rotate_db_password``: generates a new Postgres password
    candidate + the runbook that sets it. Same operator-applies
    pattern.

  * ``rotate_bunny_token``: no integration in code today, so the
    service emits a runbook only. Listed for completeness so the
    super-admin UI button is non-misleading: it tells the operator
    exactly which dashboard to log into rather than promising
    work the platform can't do.

  * ``rotate_email_creds``: per-tenant, real Django side effects.
    Clears every ``TenantEmailConfig.smtp_password`` and flips
    ``is_verified=False`` — forces the tenant office to re-enter
    fresh credentials before the next outbound email.

``rotate_field_encryption`` has its own dedicated management command
(chunked over millions of ciphertext rows) and is NOT dispatched
through this service — see ``rotate_field_encryption.py``. The other
rotation kinds (Redis password, backup encryption key, off-site backup
credentials, DNS API token) are operator-side only; their checklist
item's description is the runbook.

Design notes
------------
* Generated secrets are returned in the ``RotationResult``; callers
  must surface them to the operator (modal, command stdout) and then
  drop them. We never log secret VALUES — only the rotation event
  (kind + actor + timestamp).

* ``dry_run`` is honoured by ``rotate_email_creds`` (the only
  rotation that mutates state). The secret-generators are
  side-effect-free either way; dry-run there just clarifies intent.

    and treat it as sensitive.

    ``instructions`` is the runbook the operator follows AFTER reading
    the generated secret. For rotations that have side-effects of
    their own (``rotate_email_creds``), the instructions describe
    what just happened + what the tenant office now needs to do.

    ``items_affected`` is the count of rows the service modified.
    Always 0 for the secret-generator rotations (Django doesn't own
    the destination state).
