"""Email alerts to the platform operator (``ADMINS``) for events a log line alone
would leave unnoticed.

Container logs are kept in the server's journal, which nobody watches; an event
that needs a person also goes out as an email. An optional throttle keeps an
event that repeats (every lockout of an attack, a nightly sweep that finds the
same problem again) to one email per window; the caller's log line stays the
full record. A domain-free module, safe to import from any app.
