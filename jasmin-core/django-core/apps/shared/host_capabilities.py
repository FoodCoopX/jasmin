"""What this deployment of jasmin offers, so the frontend can hide the rest.

Jasmin runs standalone, or inside a host application that installs only part of
it and stands in for the rest with its own features. Such a host names itself in
its Django settings as ``JASMIN_HOST``. Jasmin's own settings don't name one; a
``JASMIN_HOST`` environment variable then can, which previews the embedded mode
on a dev stack, and without either it runs standalone. The host's name stays in
this module: the API reports the capabilities below, and the frontend asks for a
capability, never for a host.

Tapir installs only jasmin's commissioning and tenant apps, routes only their
APIs plus its own login and token refresh, and handles logins, users and data
protection itself. It delivers the weekly share demand as import batches and
keeps no subscriptions in jasmin.

A domain-free module, safe to import from any app.

    * ``support_tickets`` — the help button's support tickets (``/api/support/``).

      request, and the office's subject access and erasure of a reseller or a
      member (``/api/gdpr/``).
    * ``user_accounts`` — jasmin's own logins: sign-in, registration and
      passwords, the profile, two-factor authentication, logout and the users
      page (``/api/auth/`` beyond login and token refresh).
    * ``operating_mode_choice`` — the office's choice of the operating mode
      (``uploads_weekly_share_amount``); a host that fixes the mode leaves
      nothing to choose, see ``share_demand_is_imported``.
    * ``legal_notice`` — jasmin's own legal notice ("Impressum") and its
      settings; a host publishes its own.
    * ``web_app`` — installing jasmin as an app on a phone or desktop, with its
      icon and short name; jasmin inside a host's page isn't installed on its
      own.
    * ``manual_share_import`` — the office's own upload of the weekly share
      amounts; Tapir imports them on every visit, and a manual import there
      would compete with it.
    * ``delivery_stations`` — jasmin's delivery-station pages: the station list,
      the delivery tours, the tour and pickup lists and the station fees, the
      "also a delivery station" flag of resellers and sellers, and adding,
      deleting and setting the validity of the share delivery days. Tapir syncs its pickup
      locations into jasmin, with the delivery days they follow from, knows the
      members at each and handles them itself.
