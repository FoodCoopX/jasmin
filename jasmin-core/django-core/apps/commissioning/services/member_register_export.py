"""GenG §30 Mitgliederliste — date-range member-register CSV export.

The cooperative must keep a member list documenting, per member, their name +
address, date of joining (Eintritt) and leaving (Austritt), and the cooperative
shares + paid-in capital held. This builds that register for a [date_from,
date_to] window: every member who was a member at any point in the window —
including those who left mid-window — so the Austritt column carries real data.

Headers are deliberately German + untranslated (machine-readable export; only
delimiter / decimal separator / date format are localized via the tenant's
``csv_format`` — see ``utils/csv_format.py``).
