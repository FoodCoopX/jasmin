        concurrent overlapping recomputes (or a recompute vs. a bulk stock write)

        ``collect_movements`` hands even

        Depending on the active planning mode the form often

        tour and collides with any explicit station entry — the
        downstream ``(share, station)`` dedupe in

            2. tour-specific     (mid — names a tour, fans to all
               stations on that tour)
            3. bare              (least — no tour or station,
               fans to every station on the day)

        Only the highest tier present in the group is emitted; the
        lower tiers are dropped as redundant.

        Zero-amount entries are also dropped at the source. ``0``
        semantically means "no plan for this tour/station", NOT
        "plan zero share content" — the frontend ships a zero-
        filled scaffold for every tour and station on every row
