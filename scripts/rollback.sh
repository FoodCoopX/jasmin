#   ./scripts/rollback.sh <release>   # switch back to one of them
#
# deploy.sh tags every release's images with the UTC time and git short hash
# of its build (20261002-180133-a1b2c3d) and keeps the last few
# (KEEP_RELEASES there). A rollback points the tag compose runs (IMAGE_TAG) at
# an earlier release's images and recreates backend, huey, frontend and
# backup. The checkout stays where it is: revert or fix forward, push, and the
# next ./scripts/update.sh deploys HEAD again — until then don't re-run it, or
# it rebuilds the release you just left.
#
# Migrations are forward-only, so the earlier code runs on the database as it
# is now. A release with a migration the database hasn't applied is refused:
# its migrations have to be a prefix of the applied ones. The migrations the
# database has that the release doesn't know are listed for you to confirm —
# additive ones are fine, a dropped or renamed column the earlier code still
# uses is not.
